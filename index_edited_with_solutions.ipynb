    "In this section we saw how to associate data together in a collection, called a list.  A list is similar to a list in the real world - it implies the data has some connection, and that it has an order to it.  We initialize a list with the brackets, `[]`, and separate each element by a comma.  To access elements from a list, we use the bracket accessor followed by the index of the element we want to retrieve, and our indices begin at zero and increase from there. To add a new element to the end of the list we use the `append` method, and to remove an element from the end of a list we use `pop`. We can change elements anywhere between by first accessing the elements and then reassigning them."
